            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p>
                I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organisation. With over a
                decade of experience in compliance operations at PayPal and other leading technology
                companies, I have honed expertise in KYC/KYB/AML, team leadership, data analysis and
                process optimisation. In my current role as Senior Supervisor, I lead a team of seventeen
                compliance investigators, design coaching frameworks using SharePoint and the Microsoft
                Power Platform, and coordinate with global stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hands'on experience ranges from highrisk investigations to building automation tools
                such as Project L.E.M.M.Y., a performance tracker that leverages PowerApps and SharePoint
                to automate coaching metrics. I am passionate about developing teams, driving continuous
                improvement and leveraging technology to enhance compliance operations. Coupled with my
                technical background in Python, SharePoint development and data analysis, I am confident
                that I can contribute meaningfully to your organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br>Pedro Baron</p>
